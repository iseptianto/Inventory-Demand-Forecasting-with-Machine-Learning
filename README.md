A machine learning project to forecast future product demand based on historical sales data. The goal is to help companies optimize inventory levels, avoid stockouts, and reduce holding costs.

### üìù Project Description

This project focuses on building a time-series forecasting model to predict the demand (sales quantity) for an item in a future period (e.g., daily or weekly). By analyzing historical trends, seasonality, and other patterns, this model provides a quantitative estimate that can be used as a basis for inventory planning and procurement.

### üéØ Background & Business Case

Effective inventory management is key to success in the retail and manufacturing sectors. Companies often face two main problems:

1.  **Overstocking**: Leads to high storage costs, risk of damage or obsolescence, and capital being tied up in unproductive assets.
2.  **Stockouts**: Results in lost sales opportunities, customer dissatisfaction, and the potential for customers to switch to competitors.

Accurate demand forecasting serves as the bridge to balance these two issues. With data-driven predictions, companies can make smarter decisions about when and how much inventory to order.

### ‚ú® Key Features

  - **Time-Series Data Analysis**: In-depth exploration of historical sales data to identify trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
  - **Feature Engineering**: Creating informative features from time-series data, such as lag features, rolling window statistics (moving averages), and date-based attributes (day of the week, month, holidays).
  - **Advanced Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes a gradient boosting model like **XGBoost**, which has proven to be reliable for tabular and forecasting data.
  - **Forecasting Model Evaluation**: Measures prediction accuracy using standard metrics for time-series regression such as MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.

### üìä Dataset

This model can be trained using a company's internal transactional data or public datasets from platforms like Kaggle. An ideal data structure would contain the following columns:

  - `date`: The date of the transaction/sale.
  - `store_id`: A unique ID for each store or warehouse.
  - `item_id`: A unique ID for each product or SKU (Stock Keeping Unit).
  - `sales` / `demand`: **(Target Variable)** The number of units sold on that date.

External features such as `holidays` or `promotions` information can also be added to improve the model's accuracy.

### üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

  - **Language**: Python 3.8+
  - **Analysis Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy
  - **Visualization Libraries**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
  - **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn (for preprocessing), XGBoost / LightGBM


### üß† Methodology and Model

This project transforms a time-series forecasting problem into a **supervised learning** problem. This allows us to use tree-based models like XGBoost.

**1. Feature Engineering:** This is the most crucial step.

  - **Time-based Features**: Creating features from the date column, such as day of the week, week of the year, month, quarter, and year.
  - **Lag Features**: Using sales values from previous periods (e.g., sales from 1 week ago, 2 weeks ago) as predictor features.
  - **Rolling Window Features**: Calculating statistics (like mean, standard deviation, min, max) of sales over a specific time window (e.g., the 7-day moving average of sales).

**2. Model Used:**

  - **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)**: Chosen for its excellent performance, its ability to handle complex interactions between features, and its scalability.

**3. Evaluation:**
The model's performance is evaluated on a validation set using the following metrics:

  - **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: The average of absolute errors, easy to interpret.
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Gives more weight to large errors.
  - **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Measures error in percentage terms, useful for business presentations.
